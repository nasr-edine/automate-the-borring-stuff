## Practice Question 5: Evaluating spam[:2]

### Question:
Given the list `spam = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`, what does the expression `spam[:2]` evaluate to?

### Answer:
In Python, the slicing operation `spam[:2]` selects elements from the beginning of the list up to, but not including, the element at index `2`.

- `spam[:2]` evaluates to `['a', 'b']` because it includes elements at indices `0` and `1`, which are `'a'` and `'b'` respectively.

### Example:
```python
spam = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']  # The list
result = spam[:2]  # Slicing the first two elements
print(result)  # Output: ['a', 'b']
```

### Summary:
The expression `spam[:2]` evaluates to `['a', 'b']` when `spam` contains the list `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`.
