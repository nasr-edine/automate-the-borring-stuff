## Question 16: Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?

In Python, variables that "contain" list values actually contain references to the lists, not the lists themselves.

### Explanation:
- When you assign a list to a variable, you are assigning a reference to the memory location where the list is stored.
- The `id()` function in Python returns the unique identifier for an object, which corresponds to the memory address of that object.
- This means that if you assign one list to another variable, both variables will reference the same list in memory.
- Modifying the list through one variable will affect the list seen through the other variable.

### Example:
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = list1

print(id(list1))  # Example Output: 140352627898112
print(id(list2))  # Example Output: 140352627898112 (same as list1)

list2.append(4)

print(list1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(list2)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Explanation of the Example:
- The `id(list1)` and `id(list2)` both output `140352627898112`, indicating that `list1` and `list2` are referencing the same memory location.
- When `list2.append(4)` is called, the change is reflected in both `list1` and `list2`, since they are the same list in memory.

### Summary:
- Variables "containing" lists actually contain references to the memory location of the lists.
- The `id()` function can be used to confirm that different variables can reference the same list in memory.
- Modifications to the list via one variable will affect the same list referenced by another variable.
