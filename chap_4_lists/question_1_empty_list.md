## Question 1: What is `[]`?

In Python, `[]` represents an empty list. A list is a mutable, ordered collection of items, which can be of any data type. Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python, and `[]` is the literal syntax used to create an empty list.

### Example:
```python
my_list = []  # Creates an empty list
print(my_list)  # Output: []
```

### Summary:
`[]` is used to denote an empty list in Python, which can later be populated with elements or remain empty as needed.
