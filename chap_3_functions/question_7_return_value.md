## Return Values in Functions

**Question 7**: What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?

### What is a Return Value?

A return value is the result that a function provides back to the caller when it finishes executing. The `return` statement is used in a function to send the result back to where the function was called. This allows the function to output data or results for further use.

**Syntax Example:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

In this example, `a + b` is the return value of the function `add`.

### Can a Return Value Be Part of an Expression?
Yes, a return value can indeed be part of an expression. This means you can use the result of a function directly within other expressions or operations.

**Example:**

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

result = square(5) + 10  # Here, square(5) returns 25, which is used in the expression
print(result)  # Output: 35
```

- In the above example, `square(5)` returns `25`, which is then added to `10` to produce the final result `35`.

- The return value of the function `square(5)` is used as part of the expression `square(5) + 10`.

### Summary
A return value is the output of a function that is sent back to the caller. It can be used directly in expressions and combined with other operations, making functions highly versatile in programming.
